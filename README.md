# ModelFusion Terminal App Starter

Welcome to the ModelFusion Terminal App Starter. This guide helps you get started with a terminal application that leverages GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI. Follow the steps below to set up your environment.

## Get the Code

Clone this repository to your local machine.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lgrammel/modelfusion-terminal-app-starter.git
```

## Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install required packages.

```sh
cd modelfusion-terminal-app-starter
npm install
```

## API Key Configuration

This app uses GPT-3.5-turbo, so you'll need an OpenAI API key. If you don't have one, get it from OpenAI's website.

Create a .env file in the project root.
Add your OpenAI API key like so:

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

## Launch the App

Run the following command to start the app:

```sh
npm start
```

That's it! You can now modify the starter to create your own AI terminal app.
